# Project_PHD_DAY

This is the source code for the workshop on data visualisation prepared for PHD Day March 18 2021. WIth this workshop, you will learn about the basics on visualizing your data using the statistical package R. The workshop will focus on how to generate frequently used graphics, such as the bar chart or the box and whisker plot and less frequently used graphics such as for time series or social networks. Participants will be able to practice via exercises. Basic knowledge of R is recommended, and R-studio should be installed prior to the session. A simple dataset will be provided, but participants can also use their own research-data.
