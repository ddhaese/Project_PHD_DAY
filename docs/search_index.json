The workshop will focus on how to generate frequently used graphics, such as the scatter plot, the (ordered) bar chart or the box and whisker plot. Participants will be able to practice via exercises. Basic knowledge of R is recommended, and R-studio should be installed prior to the session. A simple dataset will be provided, but participants can also use their own research-data.

On the top of the screen in RStudio you will find the button to allow you create a new project or quickly switch between projects. Follow the RStudio wizard to create a new project in a folder of your choice (best locally during workshop) 1.3 New RMarkdown report By default data scientists work with notebooks and for R this means RMarkdown notebook (.rmd extension). Not only do notebooks offer enhanced reproducibility. Once you get used to them, you will find them increasing your productivity: Make a new rMarkdown file through New File &gt; R Markdown Give your HTML document a title (HTML is the default doc type but there are many more) If your RStudio asks for it, let it install the necessary packages You will notice that RStudio has made an example file for you Use the Save-button or Ctrl + S to save it in the root of your project folder (b.t.w., use Alt + Shift + K for an overview of available shortcuts) Let us immediate test the parsing of the report. Run or knit it by pressing the knit-button or use the shortcut Ctrl + Shift K If all goes well, you should see the example report appearing in the viewer pane of your RStudio. "]]
